However, you need technical know and experience in order to benefit from PPC advertising on Google Ads platform. Hiring a professional who focuses on Google Ads search is very important because they will look for effective ways to bring targeted traffic to your site that converts into leads calling or filling out form requesting a quote or appointments.<br><br>Are you thinking of setting a Google Ads account or already have one but could do better? If yes then below are to 5 reasons why you should hire our us to manage your&nbsp; Google Ads account.<br><br><strong>1. OUR ADS RESULTS IN VERIFIED CALLS &amp; ONLINE FORMS</strong><br><strong>Every business wants to invest their money on a digital marketing platform that brings measurable results.</strong><br>With so many digital marketing platforms, most businesses find it difficult to choose a platform that brings measurable results. When you hire our Google Ads search management services, we promise you that our digital marketing&nbsp;campaign will bring measurable results, tracking both calls and online forms using our conversion tracking infrastructure to tell which keywords, and ads that we are bidding on resulted in someone calling or filling out a form requesting a quote, appointment, or reservations.<br><br><strong>2. OUR TOOLS&nbsp;MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN GOOGLE ADS</strong><br><strong>You need to have right marketing tools to effectively conduct digital marketing.</strong><br>To conduct your marketing campaigns successfully on Google Ads, you need to have the appropriate marketing tools and services to help you succeed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>When you hire us on the LEASE option the tools and services that we use will be included in the price of the monthly management tool, the upside to the LEASE option is you do not need to buy or subscribe to the tools that we use for you. The downside of the LEASE option is if you stop working with us, the tools and services will not be handed-over or transferred to you.&nbsp;<br><br>This is why I recommend the OWN option. With this option we build you the conversion tracking infrastructure (CTI). The benefit of this is you are 100% in control of your CTI, and if you stop working with me the CTI is yours. The downside is everything build for you will be in your business name, you will have to pay the subscription or cost associated with that tool.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>3. USING GOOGLE ANALYTICS TO OPTIMIZE FOR RETURN</strong><br><strong>Most people usually think that the cost of hiring a professional marketing agency is expensive when compared to conducting digital marketing on their own.</strong><br>However, they usually discover later that the cost of hiring a reputable marketing professional is actually much cheaper when compared to spend and results. We will use our efficient marketing tools and expertise to ensure that you are getting leads from your Google Ads search campaigns.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>4. WE CONDUCT CONSTANT TRACKING, OPTIMIZATION AND ANALYSIS TO ENSURE SUCCESS</strong><br><strong>We have set a very effective PPC campaign that tracks everything from how your targets keywords are performing to tracking the hot leads that are being generated.&nbsp;</strong><br>This is very important because it enables us to track your return on investment by looking at your spend data and the number of good leads that were generated. Our success in monitoring Google Ads PPC campaigns has been attributed to our constant optimization, tracking and analysis.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>5. EXPERIENCED GOOGLE ADS MANAGEMENT COMPANY</strong><br><strong>As a reputable and experienced marketing agency, we have worked with other clients in various industries and we have competitive knowledge that we can apply on your account to give you a competitive edge.</strong><br>Hiring a digital marketing professional who is focused on Google Ads search is important to ensure that your PPC campaign is successful in generating leads for your service-based business.&nbsp;<br><br>Hiring a professional to manage your Google Ads PPC campaigns can give you a competitive edge over your competitors.
